#+title: Philippe Emacs config
#+PROPERTY: header-args:emacs-lisp :tangle ./init.el :mkdirp yes

* Welcome!

This is my configuration file build from multiple source thanks to *uncle Dav* and *system crafters* and the series of videos *Emacs From Scratch* 
The following variables are used to tweak some of the configuration pieces for use in the live streams so you might need to adjust them for your local machine if you try to use this configuration directly.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  ;; NOTE: init.el is now generated from Emacs.org.  Please edit that file
  ;;       in Emacs and init.el will be generated automatically!

  ;; You will most likely need to adjust this font size for your system!
  (defvar myEmacs/default-font-size 140)
  (defvar myEmacs/default-variable-font-size 180)

  ;; Make frame transparency overridable
  (defvar myEmacs/frame-transparency '(90 . 90))

* Tips for Use

In this document I've added links in many places that lead you to documentation for the various packages we use.  If you're looking at this file in Emacs, you can put your cursor on a link and 
press =C-c C-o= or run =M-x org-open-at-point= to open the link in your web browser.

** Always murder current buffer

Doing =C-x k= should kill the current buffer at all times, we have =ibuffer= for more sophisticated thing.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun kill-current-buffer ()
    "Kills the current buffer."
    (interactive)
    (kill-buffer (current-buffer)))
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-x k") 'kill-current-buffer)
#+END_SRC

** Kill buffers without asking for confirmation

Unless you have the muscle memory, I recommend omitting this bit, as you may lose progress for no reason when working.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq kill-buffer-query-functions (delq 'process-kill-buffer-query-function kill-buffer-query-functions))
#+END_SRC

** Turn switch-to-buffer into ibuffer

I don't understand how ibuffer isn't the default option by now.
It's vastly superior in terms of ergonomics and functionality, you can delete buffers, rename buffer, move buffers, organize buffers etc.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x b") 'ibuffer)
#+END_SRC

*** expert-mode

If you feel like you know how ibuffer works and need not to be asked for confirmation after every serious command, enable this as follows.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq ibuffer-expert t)
#+END_SRC

** close-all-buffers
It's one of those things where I genuinely have to wonder why there is no built in functionality for it.
Once in a blue moon I need to kill all buffers, and having ~150 of them open would mean I'd need to spend a few too many
seconds doing this than I'd like, here's a solution.

This can be invoked using =C-M-s-k=. This keybinding makes sure you don't hit it unless you really want to.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun close-all-buffers ()
    "Kill all buffers without regard for their origin."
    (interactive)
    (mapc 'kill-buffer (buffer-list)))
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-M-s-k") 'close-all-buffers)
#+END_SRC

* Startup Performance

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  ;; The default is 800 kilobytes.  Measured in bytes.
  (setq gc-cons-threshold (* 50 1000 1000))

  (defun myEmacs/display-startup-time ()
    (message "Emacs loaded in %s with %d garbage collections."
             (format "%.2f seconds"
                     (float-time
                       (time-subtract after-init-time before-init-time)))
             gcs-done))

  (add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook #'myEmacs/display-startup-time)

#+end_src
* Package System Setup

Emacs has a built in package manager but it doesn't make it easy to automatically install packages on a new system the first time you pull down your configuration.  [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] is a really helpful package used in this configuration to make it a lot easier to automate the installation and configuration of everything else we use.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  ;; Initialize package sources
  (require 'package)

  (setq package-archives '(("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/")
                           ("org" . "https://orgmode.org/elpa/")
                           ("elpa" . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")))

  (package-initialize)
  (unless package-archive-contents
    (package-refresh-contents))

    ;; Initialize use-package on non-Linux platforms
  (unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
    (package-install 'use-package))

  (require 'use-package)
  (setq use-package-always-ensure t)

#+end_src

* Minor conveniences
Emacs is at it's best when it just does things for you, shows you the way, guides you so to speak.
This can be best achieved using a number of small extensions. While on their own they might not be particularly
impressive. Together they create a nice environment for you to work in.

** Visiting the configuration
Quickly edit =~/.emacs.d/Emacs.org=
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun config-visit ()
    (interactive)
    (find-file "~/.emacs.d/Emacs.org"))
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c e") 'config-visit)
#+END_SRC

** Reloading the configuration
   
Simply pressing =Control-c r= will reload this file, very handy.
You can also manually invoke =config-reload=.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun config-reload ()
    "Reloads ~/.emacs.d/config.org at runtime"
    (interactive)
    (org-babel-tangle-file "~/.emacs.d/Emacs.org"))
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c r") 'config-reload)
#+END_SRC


** Automatic Package Updates

The auto-package-update package helps us keep our Emacs packages up to date!  It will prompt you after a certain number of days either at startup or at a specific time of day to remind you to update your packages.

You can also use =M-x auto-package-update-now= to update right now!

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package auto-package-update
    :custom
    (auto-package-update-interval 7)
    (auto-package-update-prompt-before-update t)
    (auto-package-update-hide-results t)
    :config
    (auto-package-update-maybe)
    (auto-package-update-at-time "09:00"))

#+end_src

* Keep Folders Clean

We use the [[https://github.com/emacscollective/no-littering/blob/master/no-littering.el][no-littering]] package to keep folders where we edit files and the Emacs configuration folder clean!  It knows about a wide variety of variables for built in Emacs features as well as those from community packages so it can be much easier than finding and setting these variables yourself.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  ;; NOTE: If you want to move everything out of the ~/.emacs.d folder
  ;; reliably, set `user-emacs-directory` before loading no-littering!
  ;(setq user-emacs-directory "~/.cache/emacs")

  (use-package no-littering)

  ;; no-littering doesn't set this by default so we must place
  ;; auto save files in the same path as it uses for sessions
  (setq auto-save-file-name-transforms
        `((".*" ,(no-littering-expand-var-file-name "auto-save/") t)))

#+end_src

* Basic UI Configuration

This section configures basic UI settings that remove unneeded elements to make Emacs look a lot more minimal and modern.  If you're just getting started in Emacs, the menu bar might be helpful so you can remove the =(menu-bar-mode -1)= line if you'd like to still see that.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

    ;; Remove welcome panel and tools bar
    (setq inhibit-startup-message t)

    (menu-bar-mode -1)           ;; Disable the menue bar
    (tooltip-mode -1)            ;; Disable tooltips

    ;; Setup the graphic view
    (if (display-graphic-p)
        (progn
          (tool-bar-mode -1)     ;; Disable visible toolbar
          (scroll-bar-mode -1)   ;; Disable visible scrollbar
          (set-fringe-mode 10)   ;; Give some brathing room
          )
      )

     (setq ring-bell-function 'ignore)        ;; set up the visible bell

    ;; column and line mode
    (column-number-mode)
    (global-display-line-numbers-mode t)

    ;; Disable line numbers for some modes
    (dolist (mode '(org-mode-hook
                    term-mode-hook
                    shell-mode-hook
                    treemacs-mode-hook
                    eshell-mode-hook))
      (add-hook mode (lambda () (display-line-numbers-mode 0))))
#+end_src

** scrolling and why does the screen move

I don't know to be honest, but this little bit of code makes scrolling with emacs a lot nicer.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq scroll-conservatively 100)
#+END_SRC

** Change yes-or-no questions into y-or-n questions
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defalias 'yes-or-no-p 'y-or-n-p)
#+END_SRC

** Highligh current line

=hl-line= is awesome! It's not very awesome in the terminal version of emacs though, so we don't use that.
Besides, it's only used for programming.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (when window-system (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'hl-line-mode))
#+END_SRC

** Font Configuration


I am using the [[https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode][Fira Code]] and [[https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cantarell][Cantarell]] fonts for this configuration which will more than likely need to be installed on your machine.  Both can usually be found in the various Linux distro package managers or downloaded from the links above.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

(set-face-attribute 'default nil :font "Monaco" :height myEmacs/default-font-size)

;; Set the fixed pitch face
(set-face-attribute 'fixed-pitch nil :font "Monaco" :height myEmacs/default-font-size)

;; Set the variable pitch face
(set-face-attribute 'variable-pitch nil :font "Avenir" :height myEmacs/default-variable-font-size :weight 'regular)

#+end_src

* UI Configuration

** Color Theme

[[https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-doom-themes][doom-themes]] is a great set of themes with a lot of variety and support for many different Emacs modes.  Taking a look at the [[https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-doom-themes/tree/screenshots][screenshots]] might help you decide which one you like best.  You can also run =M-x counsel-load-theme= to choose between them easily.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

(use-package doom-themes
  :init (load-theme 'doom-wilmersdorf t))

#+end_src

** Better Modeline

[[https://github.com/seagle0128/doom-modeline][doom-modeline]] is a very attractive and rich (yet still minimal) mode line configuration for Emacs.  The default configuration is quite good but you can check out the [[https://github.com/seagle0128/doom-modeline#customize][configuration options]] for more things you can enable or disable.

*NOTE:* The first time you load your configuration on a new machine, you'll need to run `M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts` so that mode line icons display correctly.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package all-the-icons)

  (use-package doom-modeline
    :ensure t
    :init (doom-modeline-mode 1)
    :custom ((doom-modeline-height 12)))

  (display-battery-mode 1)

  (setq display-time-24hr-format t)
  (setq display-time-format "%H:%M - %d %B %Y")
  (display-time-mode 1)

#+end_src


** Which Key

[[https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key][which-key]] is a useful UI panel that appears when you start pressing any key binding in Emacs to offer you all possible completions for the prefix.  For example, if you press =C-c= (hold control and press the letter =c=), a panel will appear at the bottom of the frame displaying all of the bindings under that prefix and which command they run.  This is very useful for learning the possible key bindings in the mode of your current buffer.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package which-key
    :defer 0
    :diminish which-key-mode
    :config
    (which-key-mode)
    (setq which-key-idle-delay 1))

#+end_src

** Ivy and Counsel

[[https://oremacs.com/swiper/][Ivy]] is an excellent completion framework for Emacs.  It provides a minimal yet powerful selection menu that appears when you open files, switch buffers, and for many other tasks in Emacs.  Counsel is a customized set of commands to replace `find-file` with `counsel-find-file`, etc which provide useful commands for each of the default completion commands.

[[https://github.com/Yevgnen/ivy-rich][ivy-rich]] adds extra columns to a few of the Counsel commands to provide more information about each item.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package ivy
    :diminish
    :bind (("C-s" . swiper)
           :map ivy-minibuffer-map
           ("TAB" . ivy-alt-done)
           ("C-l" . ivy-alt-done)
           ("C-j" . ivy-next-line)
           ("C-k" . ivy-previous-line)
           :map ivy-switch-buffer-map
           ("C-k" . ivy-previous-line)
           ("C-l" . ivy-done)
           ("C-d" . ivy-switch-buffer-kill)
           :map ivy-reverse-i-search-map
           ("C-k" . ivy-previous-line)
           ("C-d" . ivy-reverse-i-search-kill))
    :config
    (ivy-mode 1))

  (use-package ivy-rich
    :after ivy
    :init
    (ivy-rich-mode 1))

  (use-package counsel
    :bind (("C-M-j" . 'counsel-switch-buffer)
           :map minibuffer-local-map
           ("C-r" . 'counsel-minibuffer-history))
    :custom
    (counsel-linux-app-format-function #'counsel-linux-app-format-function-name-only)
    :config
    (counsel-mode 1))

#+end_src

*** Improved Candidate Sorting with prescient.el

prescient.el provides some helpful behavior for sorting Ivy completion candidates based on how recently or frequently you select them.  This can be especially helpful when using =M-x= to run commands that you don't have bound to a key but still need to access occasionally.

This Prescient configuration is optimized for use in System Crafters videos and streams, check out the [[https://youtu.be/T9kygXveEz0][video on prescient.el]] for more details on how to configure it!

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package ivy-prescient
    :after counsel
    :custom
    (ivy-prescient-enable-filtering nil)
    :config
    ;; Uncomment the following line to have sorting remembered across sessions!
    ;(prescient-persist-mode 1)
    (ivy-prescient-mode 1))

#+end_src

** Helpful Help Commands

[[https://github.com/Wilfred/helpful][Helpful]] adds a lot of very helpful (get it?) information to Emacs' =describe-= command buffers.  For example, if you use =describe-function=, you will not only get the documentation about the function, you will also see the source code of the function and where it gets used in other places in the Emacs configuration.  It is very useful for figuring out how things work in Emacs.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package helpful
    :commands (helpful-callable helpful-variable helpful-command helpful-key)
    :custom
    (counsel-describe-function-function #'helpful-callable)
    (counsel-describe-variable-function #'helpful-variable)
    :bind
    ([remap describe-function] . counsel-describe-function)
    ([remap describe-command] . helpful-command)
    ([remap describe-variable] . counsel-describe-variable)
    ([remap describe-key] . helpful-key))

#+end_src

** switch-window

This magnificent package takes care of this issue.
It's unnoticeable if you have <3 panes open, but with 3 or more, upon pressing =C-x o=
you will notice how your buffers turn a solid color and each buffer is asigned a letter
(the list below shows the letters, you can modify them to suit your liking), upon pressing
a letter asigned to a window, your will be taken to said window, easy to remember, quick to use
and most importantly, it annihilates a big issue I had with emacs. An alternative is =ace-window=,
however by default it also changes the behaviour of =C-x o= even if only 2 windows are open,
this is bad, it also works less well with =exwm= for some reason.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package switch-window
  :ensure t
  :config
    (setq switch-window-input-style 'minibuffer)
    (setq switch-window-increase 4)
    (setq switch-window-threshold 2)
    (setq switch-window-shortcut-style 'qwerty)
    (setq switch-window-qwerty-shortcuts
        '("a" "s" "d" "f" "j" "k" "l" "i" "o"))
  :bind
    ([remap other-window] . switch-window))
#+END_SRC


** Following window splits

After you split a window, your focus remains in the previous one.
This annoyed me so much I wrote these two, they take care of it.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun split-and-follow-horizontally ()
    (interactive)
    (split-window-below)
    (balance-windows)
    (other-window 1))
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-x 2") 'split-and-follow-horizontally)

  (defun split-and-follow-vertically ()
    (interactive)
    (split-window-right)
    (balance-windows)
    (other-window 1))
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-x 3") 'split-and-follow-vertically)
#+END_SRC

* Org Mode

[[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]] is one of the hallmark features of Emacs.  It is a rich document editor, project planner, task and time tracker, blogging engine, and literate coding utility all wrapped up in one package.

** Better Font Faces

The =myEmacs/org-font-setup= function configures various text faces to tweak the sizes of headings and use variable width fonts in most cases so that it looks more like we're editing a document in =org-mode=.  We switch back to fixed width (monospace) fonts for code blocks and tables so that they display correctly.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (defun myEmacs/org-font-setup ()
    ;; Replace list hyphen with dot
    (font-lock-add-keywords 'org-mode
                            '(("^ *\\([-]\\) "
                               (0 (prog1 () (compose-region (match-beginning 1) (match-end 1) "•"))))))

    ;; Set faces for heading levels
    (dolist (face '((org-level-1 . 1.2)
                    (org-level-2 . 1.1)
                    (org-level-3 . 1.05)
                    (org-level-4 . 1.0)
                    (org-level-5 . 1.1)
                    (org-level-6 . 1.1)
                    (org-level-7 . 1.1)
                    (org-level-8 . 1.1)))
      (set-face-attribute (car face) nil :font "Avenir":weight 'regular :height (cdr face)))

    ;; Ensure that anything that should be fixed-pitch in Org files appears that way
    (set-face-attribute 'org-block nil    :foreground nil :inherit 'fixed-pitch)
    (set-face-attribute 'org-table nil    :inherit 'fixed-spitch)
    (set-face-attribute 'org-formula nil  :inherit 'fixed-pitch)

** Basic Config

This section contains the basic configuration for =org-mode= plus the configuration for Org agendas and capture templates.  There's a lot to unpack in here so I'd recommend watching the videos for [[https://youtu.be/VcgjTEa0kU4][Part 5]] and [[https://youtu.be/PNE-mgkZ6HM][Part 6]] for a full explanation.

*** Nicer Heading Bullets

[[https://github.com/sabof/org-bullets][org-bullets]] replaces the heading stars in =org-mode= buffers with nicer looking characters that you can control.  Another option for this is [[https://github.com/integral-dw/org-superstar-mode][org-superstar-mode]] which we may cover in a later video.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package org-bullets
    :hook (org-mode . org-bullets-mode)
    :custom
    (org-bullets-bullet-list '("◉" "○" "●" "○" "●" "○" "●")))

#+end_src

*** Center Org Buffers

We use [[https://github.com/joostkremers/visual-fill-column][visual-fill-column]] to center =org-mode= buffers for a more pleasing writing experience as it centers the contents of the buffer horizontally to seem more like you are editing a document.  This is really a matter of personal preference so you can remove the block below if you don't like the behavior.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (defun myEmacs/org-mode-visual-fill ()
    (setq visual-fill-column-width 100
          visual-fill-column-center-text t)
    (visual-fill-column-mode 1))

  (use-package visual-fill-column
    :hook (org-mode . myEmacs/org-mode-visual-fill))

#+end_src

** Configure Babel Languages

To execute or export code in =org-mode= code blocks, you'll need to set up =org-babel-load-languages= for each language you'd like to use.  [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages.html][This page]] documents all of the languages that you can use with =org-babel=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (with-eval-after-load 'org
    (org-babel-do-load-languages
        'org-babel-load-languages
        '((emacs-lisp . t)
        (python . t)))

    (push '("conf-unix" . conf-unix) org-src-lang-modes))

#+end_src

** Structure Templates

Org Mode's [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Structure-Templates.html][structure templates]] feature enables you to quickly insert code blocks into your Org files in combination with =org-tempo= by typing =<= followed by the template name like =el= or =py= and then press =TAB=.  For example, to insert an empty =emacs-lisp= block below, you can type =<el= and press =TAB= to expand into such a block.

You can add more =src= block templates below by copying one of the lines and changing the two strings at the end, the first to be the template name and the second to contain the name of the language [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages.html][as it is known by Org Babel]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (with-eval-after-load 'org
    ;; This is needed as of Org 9.2
    (require 'org-tempo)

    (add-to-list 'org-structure-template-alist '("sh" . "src shell"))
    (add-to-list 'org-structure-template-alist '("el" . "src emacs-lisp"))
    (add-to-list 'org-structure-template-alist '("py" . "src python")))

** Auto-tangle Configuration Files

This snippet adds a hook to =org-mode= buffers so that =myEmacs/org-babel-tangle-config= gets executed each time such a buffer gets saved.  This function checks to see if the file being saved is the Emacs.org file you're looking at right now, and if so, automatically exports the configuration here to the associated output files.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  ;; Automatically tangle our Emacs.org config file when we save it
  (defun myEmacs/org-babel-tangle-config ()
    (when (string-equal (file-name-directory (buffer-file-name))
                        (expand-file-name user-emacs-directory))
      ;; Dynamic scoping to the rescue
      (let ((org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil))
        (org-babel-tangle))))

  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook (lambda () (add-hook 'after-save-hook #'myEmacs/org-babel-tangle-config)))

#+end_src

* Development

** Company Mode

[[http://company-mode.github.io/][Company Mode]] provides a nicer in-buffer completion interface than =completion-at-point= which is more reminiscent of what you would expect from an IDE.  We add a simple configuration to make the keybindings a little more useful (=TAB= now completes the selection and initiates completion at the current location if needed).

We also use [[https://github.com/sebastiencs/company-box][company-box]] to further enhance the look of the completions with icons and better overall presentation.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package company
    :after lsp-mode
    :hook (lsp-mode . company-mode)
    :bind (:map company-active-map
           ("<tab>" . company-complete-selection))
          (:map lsp-mode-map
           ("<tab>" . company-indent-or-complete-common))
    :custom

  (use-package company-box
    :hook (company-mode . company-box-mode))

#+end_src

** Projectile

[[https://projectile.mx/][Projectile]] is a project management library for Emacs which makes it a lot easier to navigate around code projects for various languages.  Many packages integrate with Projectile so it's a good idea to have it installed even if you don't use its commands directly.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package projectile
    :diminish projectile-mode
    :config (projectile-mode)
    :custom ((projectile-completion-system 'ivy))
    :bind-keymap
    ("C-c p" . projectile-command-map)
    :init
    ;; NOTE: Set this to the folder where you keep your Git repos!
    (when (file-directory-p "~/Projects/Code")
      (setq projectile-project-search-path '("~/Projects/Code")))
    (setq projectile-switch-project-action #'projectile-dired))

  (use-package counsel-projectile
    :after projectile
    :config (counsel-projectile-mode))

#+end_src
** Let projectile call make
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (global-set-key (kbd "<f5>") 'projectile-compile-project)
#+END_SRC
** Magit

[[https://magit.vc/][Magit]] is the best Git interface I've ever used.  Common Git operations are easy to execute quickly using Magit's command panel system.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package magit
    :ensure t 
    :config
    (setq magit-push-always-verify nil)
    (setq git-commit-summary-max-length 50)
    :bind
    ("M-g" . magit-status)
    :custom

  ;; - https://magit.vc/manual/forge/Token-Creation.html#Token-Creation
  ;; - https://magit.vc/manual/ghub/Getting-Started.html#Getting-Started
  (use-package forge
    :after magit)

#+end_src

** Commenting

Emacs' built in commenting functionality =comment-dwim= (usually bound to =M-;=) doesn't always comment things in the way you might expect so we use [[https://github.com/redguardtoo/evil-nerd-commenter][evil-nerd-commenter]] to provide a more familiar behavior.  I've bound it to =M-/= since other editors sometimes use this binding but you could also replace Emacs' =M-;= binding with this command.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package evil-nerd-commenter
    :bind ("M-/" . evilnc-comment-or-uncomment-lines))

#+end_src

** Rainbow Delimiters

[[https://github.com/Fanael/rainbow-delimiters][rainbow-delimiters]] is useful in programming modes because it colorizes nested parentheses and brackets according to their nesting depth.  This makes it a lot easier to visually match parentheses in Emacs Lisp code without having to count them yourself.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package rainbow-delimiters
    :ensure t
    :hook (prog-mode . rainbow-delimiters-mode))

#+end_src

** Subwords

Emacs treats camelCase strings as a single word by default, this changes said behaviour.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (global-subword-mode 1)
#+END_SRC

** Electric

If you write any code, you may enjoy this.
Typing the first character in a set of 2, completes the second one after your cursor.
Opening a bracket? It's closed for you already. Quoting something? It's closed for you already.

You can easily add and remove pairs yourself, have a look.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq electric-pair-pairs '(
                           (?\{ . ?\})
                           (?\( . ?\))
                           (?\[ . ?\])
                           (?\" . ?\")
                           ))
#+END_SRC

And now to enable it

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(electric-pair-mode t)
#+END_SRC

** Beacon

While changing buffers or workspaces, the first thing you do is look for your cursor.
Unless you know its position, you can not move it efficiently. Every time you change
buffers, the current position of your cursor will be briefly highlighted now.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package beacon
    :ensure t
    :config
      (beacon-mode 1))
#+END_SRC

* Terminals

** term-mode

=term-mode= is a built-in terminal emulator in Emacs.  Because it is written in Emacs Lisp, you can start using it immediately with very little configuration.  If you are on Linux or macOS, =term-mode= is a great choice to get started because it supports fairly complex terminal applications (=htop=, =vim=, etc) and works pretty reliably.  However, because it is written in Emacs Lisp, it can be slower than other options like =vterm=.  The speed will only be an issue if you regularly run console apps with a lot of output.

One important thing to understand is =line-mode= versus =char-mode=.  =line-mode= enables you to use normal Emacs keybindings while moving around in the terminal buffer while =char-mode= sends most of your keypresses to the underlying terminal.  While using =term-mode=, you will want to be in =char-mode= for any terminal applications that have their own keybindings.  If you're just in your usual shell, =line-mode= is sufficient and feels more integrated with Emacs.

With =evil-collection= installed, you will automatically switch to =char-mode= when you enter Evil's insert mode (press =i=).  You will automatically be switched back to =line-mode= when you enter Evil's normal mode (press =ESC=).

Run a terminal with =M-x term!=

*Useful key bindings:*

- =C-c C-p= / =C-c C-n= - go back and forward in the buffer's prompts (also =[[= and =]]= with evil-mode)
- =C-c C-k= - Enter char-mode
- =C-c C-j= - Return to line-mode
- If you have =evil-collection= installed, =term-mode= will enter char mode when you use Evil's Insert mode

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package term
    :commands term
    :config
    (setq explicit-shell-file-name "bash") ;; Change this to zsh, etc
    ;;(setq explicit-zsh-args '())         ;; Use 'explicit-<shell>-args for shell-specific args

    ;; Match the default Bash shell prompt.  Update this if you have a custom prompt
    (setq term-prompt-regexp "^[^#$%>\n]*[#$%>] *"))

#+end_src

*** Better term-mode colors

The =eterm-256color= package enhances the output of =term-mode= to enable handling of a wider range of color codes so that many popular terminal applications look as you would expect them to.  Keep in mind that this package requires =ncurses= to be installed on your machine so that it has access to the =tic= program.  Most Linux distributions come with this program installed already so you may not have to do anything extra to use it.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package eterm-256color
    :hook (term-mode . eterm-256color-mode))

#+end_src

** vterm

[[https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm/][vterm]] is an improved terminal emulator package which uses a compiled native module to interact with the underlying terminal applications.  This enables it to be much faster than =term-mode= and to also provide a more complete terminal emulation experience.

Make sure that you have the [[https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm/#requirements][necessary dependencies]] installed before trying to use =vterm= because there is a module that will need to be compiled before you can use it successfully.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package vterm
    :commands vterm
    :config
    (setq term-prompt-regexp "^[^#$%>\n]*[#$%>] *")  ;; Set this to match your custom shell prompt
    ;;(setq vterm-shell "zsh")                       ;; Set this to customize the shell to launch
    (setq vterm-max-scrollback 10000))

#+end_src

** shell-mode

[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Interactive-Shell.html#Interactive-Shell][shell-mode]] is a middle ground between =term-mode= and Eshell.  It is *not* a terminal emulator so more complex terminal programs will not run inside of it.  It does have much better integration with Emacs because all command input in this mode is handled by Emacs and then sent to the underlying shell once you press Enter.  This means that you can use =evil-mode='s editing motions on the command line, unlike in the terminal emulator modes above.

*Useful key bindings:*

- =C-c C-p= / =C-c C-n= - go back and forward in the buffer's prompts (also =[[= and =]]= with evil-mode)
- =M-p= / =M-n= - go back and forward in the input history
- =C-c C-u= - delete the current input string backwards up to the cursor
- =counsel-shell-history= - A searchable history of commands typed into the shell

One advantage of =shell-mode= on Windows is that it's the only way to run =cmd.exe=, PowerShell, Git Bash, etc from within Emacs.  Here's an example of how you would set up =shell-mode= to run PowerShell on Windows:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (when (eq system-type 'windows-nt)
    (setq explicit-shell-file-name "powershell.exe")
    (setq explicit-powershell.exe-args '()))

#+end_src

** Eshell

[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eshell.html#Contributors-to-Eshell][Eshell]] is Emacs' own shell implementation written in Emacs Lisp.  It provides you with a cross-platform implementation (even on Windows!) of the common GNU utilities you would find on Linux and macOS (=ls=, =rm=, =mv=, =grep=, etc).  It also allows you to call Emacs Lisp functions directly from the shell and you can even set up aliases (like aliasing =vim= to =find-file=).  Eshell is also an Emacs Lisp REPL which allows you to evaluate full expressions at the shell.

The downsides to Eshell are that it can be harder to configure than other packages due to the particularity of where you need to set some options for them to go into effect, the lack of shell completions (by default) for some useful things like Git commands, and that REPL programs sometimes don't work as well.  However, many of these limitations can be dealt with by good configuration and installing external packages, so don't let that discourage you from trying it!

*Useful key bindings:*

- =C-c C-p= / =C-c C-n= - go back and forward in the buffer's prompts (also =[[= and =]]= with evil-mode)
- =M-p= / =M-n= - go back and forward in the input history
- =C-c C-u= - delete the current input string backwards up to the cursor
- =counsel-esh-history= - A searchable history of commands typed into Eshell

We will be covering Eshell more in future videos highlighting other things you can do with it.

* File Management

** Dired

Dired is a built-in file manager for Emacs that does some pretty amazing things!  Here are some key bindings you should try out:

*** Key Bindings

**** Navigation

*Emacs* / *Evil*
- =n= / =j= - next line
- =p= / =k= - previous line
- =j= / =J= - jump to file in buffer
- =RET= - select file or directory
- =^= - go to parent directory
- =S-RET= / =g O= - Open file in "other" window
- =M-RET= - Show file in other window without focusing (previewing files)
- =g o= (=dired-view-file=) - Open file but in a "preview" mode, close with =q=
- =g= / =g r= Refresh the buffer with =revert-buffer= after changing configuration (and after filesystem changes!)

**** Marking files

- =m= - Marks a file
- =u= - Unmarks a file
- =U= - Unmarks all files in buffer
- =* t= / =t= - Inverts marked files in buffer
- =% m= - Mark files in buffer using regular expression
- =*= - Lots of other auto-marking functions
- =k= / =K= - "Kill" marked items (refresh buffer with =g= / =g r= to get them back)
- Many operations can be done on a single file if there are no active marks!

**** Copying and Renaming files

- =C= - Copy marked files (or if no files are marked, the current file)
- Copying single and multiple files
- =U= - Unmark all files in buffer
- =R= - Rename marked files, renaming multiple is a move!
- =% R= - Rename based on regular expression: =^test= , =old-\&=

*Power command*: =C-x C-q= (=dired-toggle-read-only=) - Makes all file names in the buffer editable directly to rename them!  Press =Z Z= to confirm renaming or =Z Q= to abort.

**** Deleting files

- =D= - Delete marked file
- =d= - Mark file for deletion
- =x= - Execute deletion for marks
- =delete-by-moving-to-trash= - Move to trash instead of deleting permanently

**** Creating and extracting archives

- =Z= - Compress or uncompress a file or folder to (=.tar.gz=)
- =c= - Compress selection to a specific file
- =dired-compress-files-alist= - Bind compression commands to file extension

**** Other common operations

- =T= - Touch (change timestamp)
- =M= - Change file mode
- =O= - Change file owner
- =G= - Change file group
- =S= - Create a symbolic link to this file
- =L= - Load an Emacs Lisp file into Emacs

* Text manipulation

Here I shall collect self-made functions that make editing text easier.

** Text Selection

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package selected
  :ensure t
  :commands selected-minor-mode
  :bind (:map selected-keymap
              ("q" . selected-off)
              ("u" . upcase-region)
              ("d" . downcase-region)
              ("w" . count-words-region)
              ("m" . apply-macro-to-region-lines)))
#+END_SRC

** Mark-Multiple

I can barely contain my joy. This extension allows you to quickly mark the next occurence of a region and edit them all at once. Wow!

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package mark-multiple
  :ensure t
  :bind ("C-c q" . 'mark-next-like-this))
#+END_SRC

** Improved kill-word

Why on earth does a function called =kill-word= not .. kill a word.
It instead deletes characters from your cursors position to the end of the word,
let's make a quick fix and bind it properly.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun daedreth/kill-inner-word ()
    "Kills the entire word your cursor is in. Equivalent to 'ciw' in vim."
    (interactive)
    (forward-char 1)
    (backward-word)
    (kill-word 1))
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c w k") 'daedreth/kill-inner-word)
#+END_SRC

** Improved copy-word

And again, the same as above but we make sure to not delete the source word.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun daedreth/copy-whole-word ()
    (interactive)
    (save-excursion
      (forward-char 1)
      (backward-word)
      (kill-word 1)
      (yank)))
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c w c") 'daedreth/copy-whole-word)
#+END_SRC

** Copy a line

Regardless of where your cursor is, this quickly copies a line.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun daedreth/copy-whole-line ()
    "Copies a line without regard for cursor position."
    (interactive)
    (save-excursion
      (kill-new
       (buffer-substring
        (point-at-bol)
        (point-at-eol)))))
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c l c") 'daedreth/copy-whole-line)
#+END_SRC

** Kill a line

And this quickly deletes a line.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c l k") 'kill-whole-line)
#+END_SRC


* Exporting options
One of the best things about org is the ability to export your file to many formats.
Here is how we add more of them!

** latex
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
